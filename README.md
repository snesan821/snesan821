### Hi, I'm Sri. 👋

I am a Computer Science student at **Arizona State University** building at the intersection of **Neuromorphic Computing** and **Cloud-Native Automation**.

I focus on high-efficiency systems—whether that's 1.58-bit neural networks for edge devices or event-driven agents for market intelligence.

### 🚀 Featured Engineering

#### 🧠 [BitNet-SNN Hybrid Engine](https://github.com/snesan821/bitnet-snn-research)
> *A neuromorphic inference engine combining 1.58-bit quantization with Spiking Neural Networks.*

* **The Breakthrough:** Achieved **91.07% accuracy** on MNIST with **~89% temporal sparsity**, proving that ternary weights and spiking dynamics can coexist for extreme inference efficiency.
* **The Tech:** Custom PyTorch layers, Surrogate Gradient learning, SpikingJelly.
* **Key Stat:** Efficiency ratio of ~0.43 compared to standard dense networks.

#### 🎵 [The Needle Drop](https://github.com/snesan821/TheNeedleDrop)
> *A containerized, event-driven market intelligence agent for vinyl collectors.*

* **The Architecture:** Serverless microservice deployed on **AWS Lambda** via Docker.
* **The Engineering:** Uses **DynamoDB** for idempotent state management and **SNS** for real-time SMS alerts.
* **The DevOps:** Fully automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
