### Hi, I'm Sri. 👋

I am a Computer Science student at **Arizona State University** blending **Cloud Engineering** with **Experimental AI Research**.

I take a dual approach to building: I engineer robust serverless systems for real-world utility, while simultaneously using LLMs to prototype bleeding-edge neuromorphic concepts.

### 🚀 Featured Projects

#### ☁️ [The Needle Drop](https://github.com/snesan821/TheNeedleDrop)
> *A production-grade, serverless market intelligence agent.*

* **Role:** **Lead Engineer** (Sole Developer)
* **The Architecture:** Designed and deployed a containerized microservice on **AWS Lambda** to scout for rare vinyl releases in real-time.
* **The Tech:** Implemented **Docker** for consistent runtime environments, **DynamoDB** for idempotent state management, and **SNS** for SMS alerting.
* **The DevOps:** Built a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions** for zero-touch deployments.

#### 🧪 [BitNet-SNN Hybrid Engine](https://github.com/snesan821/bitnet-snn-research)
> *A transparent experiment in AI-assisted research.*

* **The Goal:** I wanted to test if modern LLMs (Gemini 2.0) could successfully implement a complex **BitNet b1.58 + Spiking Neural Network** architecture from scratch.
* **The Result:** The AI-generated code achieved **91.07% accuracy** on MNIST with **~89% sparsity**, proving the viability of using LLMs for rapid deep-tech prototyping.
* **My Contribution:** Conceptual architecture, prompt engineering, validation, and benchmarking.
