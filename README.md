### Hi, I'm Sri. 👋

I am a Computer Science student at **Arizona State University** blending **Cloud Engineering** with **Experimental AI Research**.

I take a dual approach to building: I engineer robust serverless systems for real-world utility, while simultaneously using LLMs to prototype bleeding-edge concepts.
