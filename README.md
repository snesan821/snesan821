### Hi, I'm Sri. 👋

I am a Computer Science student at **Arizona State University** exploring the limits of **AI-Assisted Engineering**.

I use advanced LLMs (Gemini/GPT-4) to prototype complex Deep Tech and Cloud systems that would typically take months to build. My goal is to understand how human-AI collaboration can accelerate software development in specialized fields like Neuromorphic Computing and Serverless Automation.

### 🚀 AI-Generated Experiments

#### 🧪 [BitNet-SNN Hybrid Engine](https://github.com/snesan821/bitnet-snn-research)
> *A fully AI-generated research prototype.*

* **The Experiment:** I prompted Gemini to architect a hybrid neural network combining **BitNet b1.58 quantization** with **Spiking Neural Networks**.
* **The Result:** The AI successfully generated a working PyTorch implementation that achieved **91.07% accuracy** on MNIST with **~89% sparsity**.
* **My Role:** Prompt Engineering, Architecture Validation, Debugging, and Benchmarking.

#### 🎵 [The Needle Drop](https://github.com/snesan821/TheNeedleDrop)
> *An AI-generated, event-driven cloud agent.*

* **The System:** A serverless vinyl scouting agent deployed on **AWS Lambda**.
* **The Process:** Built entirely through natural language prompting, from the Python logic to the Docker containerization and CI/CD pipelines.

### 🛠 Tools & Methods
* **Core:** Python, Docker, AWS
* **AI Workflow:** Context-aware prompting, iterative debugging with LLMs, automated documentation generation.
